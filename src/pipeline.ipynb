    "### Pipeline overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 components in total, these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Prompt Generation**](components/generate_prompts): This component generates a set of seed prompts using a rule-based approach that combines various rooms and styles together, like “a photo of a {room_type} in the style of {style_type}”. As input, it takes in a list of room types (bedroom, kitchen, laundry room, ..), a list of room styles (contemporary, minimalist, art deco, ...) and a list of prefixes (comfortable, luxurious, simple). These lists can be easily adapted to other domains. The output of this component is a list of seed prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [**Image URL Retrieval**](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/tree/main/components/prompt_based_laion_retrieval): This component retrieves images from the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) dataset based on the seed prompts. The retrieval itself is done based on CLIP embeddings similarity between the prompt sentences and the captions in the LAION dataset. This component doesn’t return the actual images yet, only the URLs. The next component in the pipeline will then download these images.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [**Download Images**](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/tree/main/components/download_images): This component downloads the actual images based on the URLs retrieved by the previous component. It takes in the URLs as input and returns the actual images, along with some metadata (like their height and width).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [**Caption Filtering**] The LAION dataset contains a lot of low-quality captions, your task is to play around with filtering out captions that are either too long, too short, contain irrelevant data etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [**Conditioning Creation**] In this step your task is to write a component that creates a conditioning image from a given image. Unless you're running on GPU locally, it's adviced to stick to CPU-friendly transformations, like those found in [opencv](https://opencv.org/). Get creative and experiment! \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples:\n",
    "- canny edges, \n",
    "- pixelation, \n",
    "- smoothed out hue, saturation, lightness, etc.\n",
    "- Hough maps\n",
    "- blob detection"
